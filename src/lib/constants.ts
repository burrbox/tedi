		description: `The Trump administration recently passed a devastating executive order called, "Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production" to increase domestic timber production, reversing environmental policies that encompassed over half of the land protected by the US Forest Service in the process. President Trump's continued push to exploit public lands for deforestation and industry gain is detrimental to our environment and the health of our planet. Our national forests, parks, and public lands are meant to maintain biodiversity and protect wildlife habitats, not to fuel corporate greed.

Since President Trump was inaugurated, he passed numerous executive orders that put millions of acres of undisturbed land at risk of logging, mining, and industrial development. These destructive practices threaten our ecosystems, endangered species, and the air and water we all depend on. Additionally, disturbing these forests will destroy thousands of old, fire resistant trees that will leave lands more susceptible to forest fires. Old trees are often carbon-rich and are therefore essential to fighting climate change. With them gone, the impacts of global warming will increase exponentially and species residing in these forests will become endangered.

We demand that the Trump Administration revoke the executive order "Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production" that ordered over 280 million acres of public lands and national forests be destroyed to increase timber production. This executive order directly contradicts the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which both work to protect public lands. The United States has become a country that is fiercely committed to protecting the environment and fighting for a more sustainable future, as evidenced by its environmentally friendly legislation and policies. We depend on the environment and its resources to survive. We must give back to it by upholding our commitment to environmental conservation. Sign this petition to protect our forests, our climate, and our future.`,

		title: "Protect the East Fishkill from the Woodland Estates Luxury Apartment Complex",
		description: `Woodland Estates is a proposed rental development community in the town of East Fishkill calling for 468 luxury apartments in 23 buildings, 900 parking spots, and various lavish amenities. While this project may satisfy the growing demand for single-family homes in East Fishkill, it will have severe environmental repercussions including worsened air quality and local ecosystem damage.

The luxury apartment complex will occupy 35 acres of undeveloped land and include lavish amenities such as clubhouses, pools, and pickleball courts. Considering East Fishkill has no shortage of these kinds of facilities, the exorbitant amount of land that the project would take up is completely unnecessary considering the development would harm local ecosystems and displace native species. In addition, the plan calls for the waste system of the apartments to connect to the general waste facilities of East Fishkill. The construction of this system would involve drilling underneath Shenandoah Creek, a process that would create noise pollution, destroy natural habitats, and disturb wildlife. Moreover, building these apartments would cause serious congestion on NY-376, lengthening commute times and thus increasing vehicle emissions.

Allowing the Woodland Estates to be built would drastically reduce air quality and destroy fragile ecosystems in East Fishkill. Our town needs to emphasize the protection of natural lands, rather than construct unneeded luxury apartments with unnecessary amenities. We cannot compromise the health of our environment for the sake of capital gain. Sign our petition today to urge the town planning board to reject the Woodland Estates community development project.`,

	// 		description: `Treetop Development, a real estate investment firm, is threatening the livelihood of East Fishkill residents and putting our precious wetlands at risk for environmental catastrophe. They have proposed the Treetop Planned Industrial Development Project, an initiative that details the construction of two massive industrial warehouses on the wetlands of Wiccopee, a crucial habitat for various native plants and animals. Not only would this project disrupt the quiet and serene environment East Fishkill residents pride themselves on, but also provide prime conditions for an ecological disaster of epic proportions.

	// According to the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, wetlands provide invaluable ecosystem services including habitats for a wide variety of protected species, preservation of biodiversity, and maintenance of water and air quality. Additionally, wetlands are responsible for the regulation of surface water flow and serve as reservoirs for floodwaters, serving our community from both an environmental and sociological standpoint. The construction of these warehouses would wreak havoc on the ecosystem of the Wiccopee wetlands and our quality of life by causing deforestation, noise pollution, water contamination, air pollution, and habitat loss.

	// We must unite as a community to prevent the construction of these warehouses and fight for a more sustainable future for later generations. No longer can we sit by and allow large corporations to destroy our environment and our quality of life along with it. Sign our petition today to urge Treetop Development and the East Fishkill town board to abandon the construction of these warehouses. Act now!`,

	// 		description: `The water catastrophe is expanding rapidly and inevitably across the United States, threatening the health of millions of people and calling into question the diligence of environmental organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency. The Flint Water Crisis began in 2014 when the city of Flint, Michigan decided to switch the source of their water from the Delaware River to the Flint River. This new source of water was not treated as scrupulously as its predecessor, allowing lead that entered the Flint River from corroded pipes to infiltrate the water supply.

	// 	Lead concentrations in the blood of Flint citizens are significantly higher currently than they were when the Delaware River was used as the city’s main water supply. Lead is known to cause severe health	issues including hypertension, anaemia, and most notably Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia. 12 people have died from this deadly respiratory disease and dozens more are forced to live	with the side effects of lead poisoning on a daily basis in Flint, Michigan.

	// 	The Flint Water Crisis sparked national outrage and investigations into government negligence and environmental injustice. In 1986 the US Environmental Protection Agency passed the Safe Drinking Water Act which banned the use of lead in the construction of water pipes. Yet, plumbing systems in the majority of homes in Flint still boast lead apparatus, compromising the safety of drinking water.

	// 	Now, how can we prevent this issue from persisting in the future? Many have looked toward the lead standard which currently stands at 15µg/L in Michigan. Experts and EPA officials claim the standard must be decreased to 10µg/L in order for drinking water to truly be deemed “safe.” The only way to prevent this issue from expanding and impairing the health of more Americans is to address the root cause of the issue: a lack of action by the EPA in enforcing water quality standards. Urge the EPA to lower the standard for lead concentrations in drinking water to 10µg/L and mandate the removal of lead pipes from plumbing systems TODAY. Fight for our future and the people of Flint!`,
